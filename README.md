Project Title
Media Capture and Storage Mobile Application

Duration
3-4 Days

Objective
Develop a mobile application using React Native that allows users to record videos and capture images. The captured media should be stored in the backend, using either AWS S3 or by storing the media in a backend folder using Multer. Authentication can be implemented without encryption or using third-party authentication APIs. Use any relational or non-relational database for backend data storage.

Project Requirements
1. User Authentication
Implement user registration and login functionalities without session management.
Authentication can be done without encryption or by using third-party authentication APIs (e.g., Firebase Authentication, Auth0).
2. Media Capture
Implement functionality for users to record videos and capture images using the device's camera.
Allow users to preview captured images and videos before saving.
3. Media Storage
Store the captured media in the backend using one of the following methods:
AWS S3: Set up AWS S3 to store the media files with proper configuration and security.
Backend Folder using Multer: Set up a Node.js backend with Multer to store media files in a backend folder.
4. Media Management
Users should be able to save, view, and delete their recorded videos and captured images.
Organize media files in a user-friendly gallery format.
Display all media of the logged-in user on a single page.
5. UI/UX Design
Design a clean and user-friendly interface.
Ensure responsiveness across different device sizes.
6. State Management
Use a state management library (e.g., Redux, Context API) to manage the application state.
7. API Integration
Set up a backend using a tool like Node.js to handle user authentication and media management.
Implement API endpoints for uploading, retrieving, and deleting media files.
Use any relational (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) or non-relational (e.g., MongoDB, MariaDB) database for backend data storage.
8. Error Handling
Implement proper error handling and validation for all user inputs and API interactions.
9. Code Quality
Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
Follow best practices for React Native development.
Submission Guidelines
Provide a link to a GitHub repository with your project code.
Include a README file with instructions on how to set up and run the project locally.
Record a short video (3-5 minutes) demonstrating the application's functionalities and explaining your approach.
Evaluation Criteria
Completeness of the project requirements.
Code quality and organization.
User interface design and user experience.
Proper implementation of state management.
Overall functionality and performance of the application.
